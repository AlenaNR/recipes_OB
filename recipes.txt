Hokkaido Pumpkin Soup Recipe

#Ingredients:
- 1 medium Hokkaido pumpkin (about 1 kg)
- 1 large onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 medium potato (optional, for extra creaminess)
- 750 ml vegetable broth
- 200 ml coconut milk (optional for creaminess)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A pinch of nutmeg (optional)
- Fresh herbs for garnish (e.g., parsley or chives)

#Instructions:

1. Prepare the Pumpkin:
   - Cut the Hokkaido pumpkin in half. Scoop out the seeds and stringy fibers. You can choose to peel the pumpkin or leave the skin on, as Hokkaido pumpkin skin is edible and softens well when cooked.
   - Cut the pumpkin into small cubes.

2. Sauté the Aromatics:
   - In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent (about 5 minutes).
   - Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute, being careful not to let it brown.

3. Cook the Pumpkin:
   - Add the pumpkin cubes and, if using, the diced potato to the pot.
   - Stir to combine and cook for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the pumpkin to soften slightly.

4. Add Broth:
   - Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.
   - Once boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the pumpkin is completely tender.

5. Blend the Soup:
   - Remove the pot from heat. Using an immersion blender, puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, you can carefully transfer the soup to a regular blender in batches.

6. Add Coconut Milk:
   - Stir in the coconut milk (if using) and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Return to low heat to warm through.

7. Serve:
   - Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh herbs. You can also drizzle a bit more coconut milk on top for an attractive finish.

Enjoy your comforting and creamy Hokkaido pumpkin soup!
